Binary Tree - It is a binary tree in which data is inserted in a particular pattern where the nodes having the 
key (value) less then that of root will be placed on the left side the key grater then the root 
will be placed in the right side.

Properties of BST - 
1. The nodes which are less then the root node is on left side and grater on right side .
2. If you find out the inorder traversal of any Binary Search Tree (BST), it will always give you the nodes in sorted (ascending) order.



givern : PostOrder - 20, 40 , 30, 60 , 80, 70, 50   (left, right, root)
create binary tree - 
 ->  inorder will be  - 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80
