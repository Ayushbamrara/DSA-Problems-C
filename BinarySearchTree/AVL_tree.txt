                          AVL tree - (balanced trees)

Are also knows as balanced trees, and where each nodes is balanced after insertion, the balancing is done
according to a  balance factor that is {-1, 0, 1}.
If the balance factor is not in range (imbalancing) in that case we use rotation to balance the tree.

4 types of avl tree - 

1. Left Rotation
2. Right Rotation
3. Left-Right Rotation
4. Right-Left Rotation
