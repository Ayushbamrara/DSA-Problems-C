Graph - Non linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges , the vertices are also reffered as nodes and
the edge  are line or arc that conncet any two nodes in the graph.
so we can denote graph of - G(V,E)

Component of graph - 
1. vertices
2. edge

vertices - fundamental unit of graph also known as nodes can be labelled or un labelled.
edge - used to connect two nodes of a graph cna be weighted or unweighted.

Types of graph -
1. Null graph  - a graph is null if there is no edge in the graph.

2. Undirected graph - Where there is no direction of edges then its undirected graph.

3. Directed graph - Graph where there is direction of edges in the graph.

4. Trivial graph - When a graph is having only 1 vertex.

5. Connected Graph - A graph in which all the nodes are connected such that we can visit from one node to another node.

6. Disconnected Graph - A graph in which atleast is one node is unreachable is known as disconnected graph.

7. Complete graph - A graph in which all nodes are directly connected to each other.

8. cyclic graph - A graph containing at least one cycle is called cyclic graph.

9. Regular graph -  A graph in which the degree of every vertex is equals to  k.  (k = number of degree). 
                    - all nodes should have same degree

10. Weighted graph - 



Representation of graph - 

1. Adjacency Matrix - 

for UnDirected graph A,B,C,D

                A-----------B 
                |           |
                |           |
                C-----------D


    1   2   3   4
1   0   1   1   1
2   1   0   1   1
3   1   1   0   1
4   


2. Adjacency List - 

for UnDirected graph A,B,C,D
                1-----------2

Difference between tree and graph 
 
1. A graph is DS with less no. of consdition then the trees.
2. Every Tree can be a graph but any graph cannot be a tree.

Application of graph - 
1.Social media 
2.Navigation system 
3.Neural network  
4.Communication system 
5.Finding the shortest path in robotic system 

Traversal of graph - 
1.BFS (Breath first search)  - Uses Queue
2.DFS (Depth first search)  - Uses Stack



               --------------------------  Spanning Tree ---------------------

Spanning Tree is a subset of graph such that all the vertices are connected using minimum no. of edges and it should
not contain any cycle.
A graph may have more than one spanning tree.

Properties - 
1. It does not exist for disconnected graph.
2. For a connected graph the edges are node-1.
3. A spanning tree does not have any cycle.
4. The number of combination are calculated cayley's formula
            N O C = N ^ N-2

---------- Applications ------------------
Finding shortest path between nodes.
Building telicommunication network.
Building Routeing protocol.
Navigation Systems.


-----------------Minimum Spanning Tree ----------------------------
A minimum spanning tre is a spannig tree that have minimum weigth amoung all possible spanning trees.\

-------------- properties ------------------------
1. It connect all the nodes.
2. Its is Acyclic.
3. edges = vertex-1;
4. Should have minimum weights.

1. Krushkal's Algorithm
problem - if graph converted into MST then the no. of nodes are disconnected.
to resolve this issue prism Algorithm come into picture.

2.Prim's Algorithm

It is an algorithm just like  Krushkal's Algorithm it always start with a single node and move through the several adjacent nodes
the main idea is to maintain the connection between two sets of vertices.
It also checks if there is no cycle and the weights are as minimum as possible.
